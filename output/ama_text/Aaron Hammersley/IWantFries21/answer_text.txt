wow, that's a lot of questions! I can answer #4!
Star on wheels was heavily influenced by a Story Daron told about when she first learned to ride a bike. What I remember from the story was that she didn't know how to brake and ended up falling in a lake.
Lava Lake beach was inspired by a story I shared in the writing room about when I was first dating my wife, I went up to the mountains with her family and ended up getting snowed in. that's one way to get to know someones parents!
