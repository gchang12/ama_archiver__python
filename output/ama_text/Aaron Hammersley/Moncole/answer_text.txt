Angie is a teacher and poet. Rafael is an artist. Here's an easter egg for you: in the season 1 episode "Cheer up Star", I added a painting in the shed which is actually a famous Van Gogh painting that had been stolen and has never been recovered. So, either Rafael is an art thief or he paints replicas of stolen paintings.
