I would like to know:
1. Why did Toffee call Marco a Disappointment in the finale of season 1?
2.  Was Monster arm bluffing that Marco would never get rid of it ..â€¦as we didn't see it ever again in the series?
3. Would you like to do some sort of continuation of the series if you  ever have the chance again?
4. Whose Voice was that which told Marco that Blood moon is the night of lovers in season 1?
