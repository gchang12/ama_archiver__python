OK, I am really bad at greeting people but hello anyway!
I have a few pretty negligible question here:

Since one minute is equal to two years in Hekapoo's dimension, which means time there runs more than a million time faster, does this mean she can be nearly as old as Glossaryck?
So, Brunzetta is like a goddess of thunder, right? (She can teleport, use power of lighting, and live for like millions of years) Is Hekapoo or the MHC aware of her existence? She's a really powerful being with magical-like powers.
Are all of her powers gone with magic? Does that mean she will die like Mother Gothel in Rapunzel?
