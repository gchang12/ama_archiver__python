First, I'd like to thank all of you for creating Star vs. the Forces of Evil. Your cheerful series got me through a difficult time and inspired me to start writing again. Thank you, truly.
My question is about the second season -- in particular, about the "Starbruary" episodes that aired in February 2017. I had a crazy theory that those episodes contained an elaborate reference to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. If I was right about that, where was that reference leading?
Thanks again for your work.
