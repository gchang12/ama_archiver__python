Oh boy! This is a lot! I will try and answer some of them. 1) Toffee was a historian and researched the Butterfly family like no one ever had before. He used his powers for evil. He's been leaning about magic for a very long time. The skulls Toffee was wearing was Butterfly family members of the royal court he killed. 2) Gonna post this again: This is a little bit of a complicated question! I was very lucky to get 4 seasons. For a variety of very boring reasons, most animated shows for kids only get about two or three seasons, max. So, I feel very lucky I got to do 4 on Star. When our 4th season got approved I knew that would most likely be the end, just because of the rarity of having a 4th season. So, I wrote an ending. I was really happy with the ending. I know a lot of fans thought it felt rushed, but I think that just means you want more. I would love to do more with Star someday. Obviously, that decision is not one I can just make. But if the powers that be wanted to make more Star I would love to work with them again. 3) Magic. And I think the Blood Moon is both a curse and and blessing. 4) Seth has been dead for a long time. We only get so many episodes per season so he'll need to just be in the book for now.
