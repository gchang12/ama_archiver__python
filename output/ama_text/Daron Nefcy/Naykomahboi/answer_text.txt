Sometimes episodes are really easy to write and sometimes they are hard. Some of the hardest are when we need to get a plot point into an episode and find a story that works around it and not have it feel shoved in or anything. I really love having very different episodes and not follow a formula. It makes writing more difficult, but more interesting I think. The most exciting part of the process for me is working with a team! I was so grateful for my team on Star! A lot of people on the show became my really good friends. Running a show is really difficult. You have to be a leader of a big team. There is always a certain amount of drama to deal with because of that.
