Hello everyone, and thank you for taking time to do this!
Daron, 
When you're sketching down an idea, what makes it stand out as something you want to work more with? Is it just a gut feeling once it's jotted down, or do you go into it hoping to create something new and exciting?
Adam,
Do you have any specific episodes or takes of Star that you remember being most excited to see the final product of? I have to imagine it can be a long wait if you're particularly proud of a specific take.
Is there any type of scene you haven't voiced yet that you'd still like to be able to try out some day?
Dominic,
What is the most exciting part of the process for you? And what is something difficult about it that people might not realize?
Thank you again everyone!
