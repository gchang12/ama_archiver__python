I'm glad you enjoyed the Star and Marco storyline! It was important to me to treat them like real teenagers...  As we all know, relationships are messy! One thing I personally don't like are storylines where characters first relationships are also there last ones... The whole prince charming thing. Thats a lie! Thats just not life! They need to date other people and have other experiences. I'm not sure what Star and Marco's future looks like but I know they are very much in love now.
