Like many fans, Star and Marco's relationship was my biggest draw to the show, and I adored it throughout and thought the way it resolved was one of the most sincere and powerful depictions of what love can be that I've seen in fiction in a while, but I'd still have loved to see them progress as a couple before the series ended like the major couples in similarly character-driven shows like Brooklyn 99 and Parks and Recreation, or like many fondly remember Kim Possible for. Were there any specific reasons you chose to keep them as friends/keep other relationships going until just before the very end despite the clear depth of their mutual romantic feelings in the S3 finale, and if you were to get the opportunity to make more SVTFOE content, would developing their relationship further (while portrayed as a couple) still likely be one of the focuses?
