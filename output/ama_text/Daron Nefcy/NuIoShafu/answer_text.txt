1) I don’t know to be honest! I’ve been taking a long break. First summer break I’ve has since I started working in animation 10 years ago! It’s been really nice. I am hoping to develop more original shows in the future. 
2) No plans as of now, but please keep asking the powers that be! I would love to do more with Star.  3) Thanks : )
