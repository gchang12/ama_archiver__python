Did Tom lose portal powers so he can’t travel to Underworld?
About Pony Heads, I dare to ask, How Pony Heads don’t have real bodies and where are theirs? Please don’t kill me! P.S. who and where is Queen pony head?
How and why Mewmans hate monster in first place if all monsters are not evil? Like Toffe being evil and Globgor being good? Is it excuse to hate monster because Magic High Commission manipulate mewmans to rule Mewni and control everything?
About Although, as revealed in The Magic Book of Spells, Globgor strongly disagreed with Toffee's plan to commit a Mewman genocide, and he advocated for peace, it isn't clear whether his own evil past deeds were due to the ongoing war between Mewmans and monsters, or sheer wickedness. Can you please explain it? Or can you better tell us about history of both Globgor and Toffee?
