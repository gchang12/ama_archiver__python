1) I would love to! Keep asking for it and maybe one day it’ll happen. Hate it keep saying it, but I can’t just decide to do it. The studio needs to feel like the show is popular enough to warrant it. Or even just that there is a need to make it.  2) This is a little bit of a complicated question! I was very lucky to get 4 seasons. For a variety of very boring reasons, most animated shows for kids only get about two or three seasons, max. So, I feel very lucky I got to do 4 on Star. When our 4th season got approved I knew that would most likely be the end, just because of the rarity of having a 4th season. So, I wrote an ending. I was really happy with the ending. I know a lot of fans thought it felt rushed, but I think that just means you want more. I would love to do more with Star someday. Obviously, that decision is not one I can just make. But if the powers that be wanted to make more Star I would love to work with them again.
