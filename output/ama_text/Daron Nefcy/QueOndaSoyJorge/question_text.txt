Hello Daron
My questions would be:
1. Do you still have plans with Star Vs The Forces Of Evil? I mean there could be a possible movie or a book that shows us what happened after the end?
2. Did you really plan for the series to last longer than you were allowed to do?
3. Would you like to do a Spin-oof of the series with Metero and Mariposa as protagonists?
4.Tom's powers were affected by destroying the magic?
5. What do you think of tom and janna's ship?
6. Could we see Star and Marco's wedding someday?
I send you a huge greeting and a hug and thank you for creating Star Vs The Forces of Evil and getting closer with their characters and their adventures
Success for you
