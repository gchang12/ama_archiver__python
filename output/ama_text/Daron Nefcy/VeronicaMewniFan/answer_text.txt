1)  My goal was to create a satisfying ending that still left room for more. I feel like it’s in the DNA of the universe to solve one problem but create another. That’s Star Butterfly! I know it may not have been satisfying for everyone, but I hope it inspires a lot of fan fiction and drawings. I didn’t want to solve everything and leave the fans nothing to play with! Plus, if I ever got to do more with Star I want something to play with. 
2)  Yes, that was a mistake. You have no idea how hard it is to keep everything consistent. I have made myself totally crazy at times trying to fix the little mistakes in every episode. It’s totally impossible to catch them all. 
3)  Not sure I understand the question.
4)  Not at this time.
