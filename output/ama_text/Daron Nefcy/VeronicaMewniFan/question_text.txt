In fact I have 4 questions:
1. Why did they decide to make an open ending (with the possibility of closing it with another story) and at the same time "throwing away" all the work (or history) that was behind?
2. In episode 4x20b) "The tavern at the end of the Multiverse" at a time Rhina the Riddled appears without her cheekmarks. Was this just a mistake when drawing or does it have any meaning?
3. Why did Starco affect such a degree that we ended up having the usual cliche of two friends who fall in love?
4. Do you have something planned to close the story?
