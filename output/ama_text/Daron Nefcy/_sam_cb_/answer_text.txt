Draw every day! And if you want to storyboard, or pitch your own show someday, write! Write and draw. And get comfortable coming up with your own characters and stories. Your drawing and writing will probably not be great at first. That’s okay! You need to just keep going and keep learning. Also draw from life! You will learn more than just doing fan art. Not that fan art is a bad thing! You just can’t be doing only that.
