The show was really inspired by childhood experiences. I was obsessed with Sailor Moon as a kid and always wanted to make a magical girl show. In my first Star pitch, she was younger and more like me as a kid. Her magic powers werenâ€™t really, they were in her imagination. She was a happy kid who was determined to save the day with no real powers and without many friends. At Disney, the executives asked for me to age her up and they led to the magic universe of Mewni and her being a foreign exchange student etc.
