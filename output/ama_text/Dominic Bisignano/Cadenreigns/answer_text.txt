As far as I know season 4 was always going to be the last one. Making an 11 minute animated series for a network like Disney is pretty complicated - not sure I can get into the intricacies of the bureaucracy, or if it would even be interesting.
I look at the show as an entire piece. As a piece I am proud of it. My favorite shows have episodes that are weird/rushed/wonky/fillery. If you’re honest and look at your favorite show, you’ll probably see this there too.  
Maybe this wasn’t your favorite show, but thanks for watching! I hope you liked what you liked 👍
