1) There’s been speculation that season four wasn’t originally intended to be the final one, what with the first half being so much slower than the second half and possible story points from earlier episodes Star potentially being replaced by a magic memory clone in “Into the Wand,” the Monster Arm’s final speech, and even the almost completely unprompted off-screen breakup between Marco and Kelly) seemingly being dropped or outright ignored to help push the final narrative. Can you confirm if there’s any truth to this, and, if so, how would you have liked to handle things differently?
2) What are the rules of the magical creatures not surviving the destruction of the magical realm? It seems the Glossaryck family didn’t survive, but it’s been stated that the laser puppies did but became “less laser-y.” But why should they survive when, as far as I’m aware, they were made of magic and not summoned from somewhere else.
3) What about Marco and Jackie’s relationship “didn’t fit” exactly? Other than cape fiasco, which came off more of Marco having a lust for adventure than anything else, and the party, pretty much every onscreen interaction they had was positive and healthy. Additionally, why did Marco and Star never take her on any adventures? She seems like she would have been a perfect fit for that.
4) The show tried to have important messages at times such as race and gender, but the final message of the show seemed to be that it’s okay to throw away your family, friends, and life in general for a relationship at 15. Do you think this is an appropriate lesson to put out there when the target demographic seems to be children at or approaching that age?
