Hi everyone!! 
These are some of my questions: 

The tapestry Glossaryck shows Star, of her destroying the magic, was it really finished? Because I could see the hole that Glossaryck left in the episode "Into the Wand".
Why does Marco not appear on Star's tapestry? I mean that the other tapestries of the queens do not show their husbands or someone very important to them, but Star's tapestry was different, we could see all the people and monsters important to her ...
