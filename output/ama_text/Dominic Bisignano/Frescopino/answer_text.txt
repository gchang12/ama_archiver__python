Personally it would have been nice to be able to ignore episode lengths. Big picture, Disney isn’t a place to try and make episodes that are slow, or that don’t have a lot “jokes”; episodes without dialog you’ll almost never see. So those are other limitations.
When we made Ludo in the Wild, it was really challenging getting that through; I can’t speak to anyone else’s preferences, but I personally would like to have done a few more stories that were slow and explored character more. What do you think?
