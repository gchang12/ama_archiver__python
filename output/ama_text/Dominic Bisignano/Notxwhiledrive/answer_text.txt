This is a great question! Anything I would have changed in retrospect? Sure! It’s complex - I don’t think the stuff I’d change and what you’d change are in the same universe. I haven’t spent much time here, but from this AMA I can see that y’all have a lot things you’d like to see!
The stuff I’d do differently has more to do with I guess pushing to get Disney to embrace doing different kinds of episodes - slower episodes, episodes that explore character over the save the cat beats, and not putting jokes in for the sake of having jokes.
