Any regrets about the show? Anything you would've changed in retrospect? Linger in this sub for a while and oh boy, you will see lot of things we would change.
Also what time period was the First mewman from? Their attire seems to indicate pilgrims from the mayflower settlers but the timeline does not work out, and they emerged from the Earth Well in California a whole coast away from where they first landed
Thanks for doing this AMA and for SvTFOE! Its cheesy to say but this is the first cartoon that truly impacted me. I have made great strides from my art directly because of this show
